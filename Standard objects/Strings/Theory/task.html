  <p>In this lesson we will consider working with string objects.<br> <br> You can <strong>create a String object</strong> in three ways:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><em>myString = 'my string' </em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // creating a string object using a string literal</li> 
   <li><em>myString = new String (object)</em> // creating an object, such syntax is not used anymore</li> 
   <li><em>myString = String (object)</em></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Such objects are typically created implicitly, by using a string literal:&nbsp;<em>var myString = 'Some text';</em><br> (a string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in any kind of quotes)<br> In a string literal, you can use any characters as well as escape sequences, for example, if you need to specify a character that can not be typed on the keyboard. It looks as follows:&nbsp;<em>var myString = '\u1234';</em>&nbsp;where 1234 is the number of the character in the unicode table.</p> 
  <p><strong>An important point!</strong>&nbsp;When you create an object using a literal (text in quotation marks), the resulting type is "string", and when you create an object using the keyword "new", you get an object with the "Object" type, which can be assigned additional properties and methods directly.</p>
