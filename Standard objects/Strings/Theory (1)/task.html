  <b>Properties of the "String" object</b>
  <br>
  <br>Although, of course, the word "properties" sounds too loud - the standard property of it is one - 
  <b>length</b>. It is denoted by the word ".
  <b>length</b>" and returns the number of characters in the string.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">var cat = "Cat";
console.log (cat.length);</code></pre> 
  <br>In this example, the value of the string length is 3.
  <br>
  <br>The value of the length of the empty string, of course, is 0.
