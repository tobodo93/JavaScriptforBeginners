  <b>To return the result</b> of the function, the keyword return is used.
  <br>
  <br>It is placed in the body of the function at the point where you want to return the result and exit the function back to the place in the code from which it was called.
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">function mySquare (x) {
&nbsp;  return x * x;
};</code></pre> 
  <br>
  <br>In the above example, the function returns the squarred value, transferred to it.
