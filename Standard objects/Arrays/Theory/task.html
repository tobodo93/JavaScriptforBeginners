  First of all, let's consider in general - 
  <b>what is an array?</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>An array</b> is a set of values ​​accessed by their ordinal number. The value in the array is called the "
  <b>array element</b>" and refers to them by their ordinal number, called the "
  <b>index</b>".
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Arrays in JavaScript are untyped -</b> allow elements of different types to be stored inside a single array. It can be not only elementary types - strings, numbers or symbols, but also objects and arrays, and even arrays of arrays.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Arrays in JavaScript start index counting from zero</b>, for indexes 32-bit values ​​are used.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic</b>, meaning they can grow or shrink in size. Announce the pre-fixed sizes when creating them, and also reallocate memory when resizing, as is done in some other languages ​​- it is not necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Arrays in JavaScript are objects!</b>
