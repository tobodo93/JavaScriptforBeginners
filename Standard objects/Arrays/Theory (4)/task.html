  <b>Delete the elements of the array.</b>
  <br>
  <br>You can 
  <b>delete an element</b> of an array using the 
  <b>delete </b>operator, as a normal property. This operator was considered in the lesson about objects. As a result of the action 
  <i><span style="color: #66cc66;"><b>delete </b>myArray [2];</span></i> the value of the third element of the array will be set to 
  <b>undefined</b>, but the number of elements in the array does not change, all other elements remain in their places.
  <br>
  <br>To 
  <b>delete elements at the end</b> of the array, you can perfectly use the array length setting command - changing the 
  <b>length </b>property, for example - 
  <i><span style="color: #66cc66;">myArray.length = 4;</span></i>
  <br>
  <br>You can also 
  <b>delete an element at the end</b> of the array using the 
  <b>pop</b>() method (opposite to the push method), which reduces the length of the array by 1 and returns the value of the deleted element.
  <br>
  <br>Also there is a method 
  <b>shift</b>() (opposite to the unshift method) which 
  <b>deletes the element at the beginning of the array</b> and shifts all the elements 1 position to the beginning.
