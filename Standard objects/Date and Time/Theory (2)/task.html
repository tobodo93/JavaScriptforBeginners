  Objects of type Date 
  <b>can be compared</b> in the same way as others.
  <br>
  <br>In the example below, we compare the current date with the date of January 1, 2018 and if it coincides - print the greeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">var currentDate = new Date ();          // Declare a variable for the current date
var nextNewYear = new Date ();          // Declare a variable for the New Year's date
nextNewYear.setFullYear (2018, 0, 1);   // Record the date value for the New Year - January 1, 2018

if (currentDate == nextNewYear) {
&nbsp;  alert ("Congratulations on the New, 2018th Year! Ur! !!!");
}</code></pre>&nbsp;
