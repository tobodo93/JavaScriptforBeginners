  In JavaScript, 
  <b>mathematical operations</b> are represented by methods of the standard 
  <b>Math object</b>.
  <br>
  <br>The 
  <b>Math </b>object has 
  <b>methods</b>, each of which performs a certain mathematical function (for example, square root, exponentiation, sine, etc.) and 
  <b>properties </b>that are actually constants - the number Pi, the number E, the natural logarithm 10 and others .
  <br>
  <br>Unlike other global objects, 
  <b>Math is not a constructor</b> - properties and methods of the 
  <b>Math </b>object are 
  <b>static</b>. This means that we can access its methods and properties directly, without creating an instance of the object. For example, you can refer to the constant pi as 
  <b>Math.PI</b> or call the sqrt (square root) function as 
  <b>Math.sqrt(x</b>).
