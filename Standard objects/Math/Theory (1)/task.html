  First, let's look at the 
  <b>constants of the Math object</b>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Math.E</b> is the number e, the base of the natural logarithm, the constant of Euler (Neper), about 2.718 ...
  <br>
  <b>Math.PI</b> is the Pi number, approximately equal, as is known, 3.1415926 ...
  <br>
  <b>Math.SQRT2</b> is the square root of 2, the approximate value is 1.414
  <br>
  <b>Math.SQRT1_2</b> is the square root of 1/2, the approximate value is 0.707
  <br>
  <b>Math.LN2</b> is the natural logarithm 2, the approximate value is 0.693
  <br>
  <b>Math.LN10</b> - natural logarithm 10, the approximate value of 2.302
  <br>
  <b>Math.LOG2E</b> is the logarithm E of base 2, an approximate value of 1.442
  <br>
  <b>Math.LOG10E</b> is the logarithm E of base 10, an approximate value of 0.434
  <br>
  <br>As an example, consider a function that receives the radius of a circle and returns its length:
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">function circumference (radius) {
&nbsp; return radius * Math.PI * 2;
}</code></pre> 
  <br>In this example, we use access to the constant Math.PI to get the value of the Pi value.
