  Cause to JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, it allows us to define our own objects and create our own variable types. And since all types of data considered in this module are objects, we are forced to begin by studying the objects and methods of working with them.
  <br>
  <br>So, an 
  <b>object</b> is a special kind of data that has properties that describe its state and methods that allow it to work with the object.
  <br>
  <br>If you go into details, then the 
  <b>object in JavaScript</b> is like associative array, that is, in fact it is a set of 
  <b>key-value</b> pairs. For example, a String object, which is any string variable, has a length property. In particular, the 
  <code>textString</code> object created by the command 
  <code>var textString = "Hello World!";</code> there will be a 
  <b>length</b> property, the key in the pair will be the name "length" and its value will be the number 12 - the actual length of the string.
