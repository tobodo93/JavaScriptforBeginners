  <p>Now we can examine in more detail the <strong>operator that searches through all the properties of the object</strong>, just mentioned in the previous module - the <strong>for .. in</strong> construct.<br> <br> The command syntax is as follows:<br> <em>for (<strong>key</strong> in <strong>object</strong>)</em>, where <strong><em>key</em></strong> is the name of the property, <em><strong>object</strong></em> is the name of the object, and access to the contents of the property is done through the expression<strong> </strong><em><strong>object [key]</strong></em>.<br> <br> Let's look at an example, creating an object with method that outputs all the properties of this object to the console:<br> &nbsp;</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">var person = {
name: "Ivan",
age: 25,
hiredYear: 2017
}

person.sayAll = function () {
&nbsp;  for (var i in this) {
console.log (i + " is " + this [i]);
&nbsp;  }
}</code></pre>
