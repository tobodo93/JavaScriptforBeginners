  In this topic, we will discuss the basics of such a concept as 
  <b>closures</b>.
  <br>
  <br>In general - 
  <b>closure</b> is a function that was declared inside another function.
  <br>There is one more condition - this function must have access to the variables of the function within which it was declared.
  <br>
  <br>Thus, such a function (
  <b>closure</b>) 
  <b>has access to data inside itself and inside the parent function</b>.
  <br>Also, the internal function can access not only the variables, but also the input parameters of its external function.
