  Well, the last element of the syntax of regular expressions is 
  <b>flags</b>. 
  <b>Flags </b>specify global rules for the entire template and are not specified within the slash characters in which the template is enclosed, but AFTER them.
  <br>
  <br>JavaScript supports three flags:
  <br>
  <b>i</b> - indicates that the pattern search must be case insensitive
  <br>
  <b>g</b> - indicates that the search should be global, i.e. all matches in the string must be found
  <br>
  <b>m</b> - indicates that the search should be performed in multi-line mode.
