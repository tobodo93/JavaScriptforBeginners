  What are 
  <b>regular expressions</b>?
  <br>
  <br>Regular expressions (
  <b>RegExp - regular expressions</b>) is an object that can describe a pattern of characters.
  <br>
  <br>For example, if you are looking for a substring in a string, you can describe a pattern of what you are looking for.
  <br>A simple template can consist of even one character, large and complex templates can be used for parsing, checking the format of entered data, replacing and other various purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>The content of the regular expression pattern consists of a sequence of characters. Most of them (all letters and numbers) describe themselves - they directly indicate their presence. For example, a regular expression
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">/hello/</code></pre>
  <br>matches all the strings that have the word "hello". Other symbols do not designate themselves, but have some modifying value.
  <br>
  <br>For example, expression
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">/hello$/</code></pre>
  <div>
    will correspond to the strings that FINISH on the word "hello". This provides the "$" metacharacter, indicating the end of the string.
