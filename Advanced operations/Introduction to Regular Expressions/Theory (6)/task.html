  Let's consider one more possibility, which we can use in regular expressions - 
  <b>grouping</b>.
  <br>
  <b>Grouping</b> is indicated by enclosing the subpattern in 
  <b>parentheses</b> (). In this case, the elements used in conjunction with special symbols, for example |, +, *,? and others, will be treated as one.
  <br>
  <br>For example, template
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">/regular(expression)?/</code></pre>
  <br>will match the word "regular" followed by the optional word "expression".
