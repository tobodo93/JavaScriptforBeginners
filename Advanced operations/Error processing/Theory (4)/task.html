  A very important point is that the 
  <b>try / catch / finally</b> constructs can be nested multiple times. In such a situation, we often need to check - what kind of exception was catched, and if this is not the exception that we were waiting for and ready to process, "not ours," then we need to send it on. We cannot use option "do not intercept", but we can intercept, check and if it's not what we need - to generate new and send on.
  <br>
  <br>Let's see how we would implement the previous example with this refinement:
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Declaration of the function
function testFactorial (inputData) {
&nbsp; if (inputData &lt;0)                                   // Check if the number is positive
&nbsp; &nbsp; throw "The number must not be less than zero";    // If negative, throw an exception

&nbsp; return (inputData - 1)? (inputData * testFactorial (inputData - 1)): inputData;
}

// Initiate the variable for the input parameter, set it manually in this example
var myNumber = -5;

// start of error handling design
try {
&nbsp; document.write (testFactorial (myNumber));           // attempt to call a function
} catch (ex) {
&nbsp; if (ex != "The number should not be less than zero") // Check - if the exception is not ours
&nbsp; &nbsp; throw (ex); // then "run" it on

&nbsp; document.write (ex);                                 // output the error if the exception is "our"
}</code></pre> 
  <br>In this example, before we display the error on the screen, we check whether it is the error that was generated by the throw statement in our function. If not, then generate it anew - as if we send a walk further, in search of its catch.
