  Lets start this topic with the concept of "
  <b>Exception</b>". Let's consider some terms:
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Exception </b>is an event that signals an abnormal situation or error.
  <br>
  <b>To excite, (create, throw) an exception</b> - to signal about any mistake or an exceptional situation.
  <br>
  <b>To catch an exception</b> is to take action to handle the exception and restore the normal functionality of the code.
  <br>
  <br>The exception is raised by the "
  <b>throw</b>" operator, the interception - by the "
  <b>catch</b>" command (more precisely, the "try-catch-finally" statement).
