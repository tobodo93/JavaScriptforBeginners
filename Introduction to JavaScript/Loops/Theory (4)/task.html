  Now consider the 
  <b>while </b>loop. It executes the block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
  <br>The syntax is as follows:
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">while (variable == final value) {
// of course, any comparison operator can be used in the loop, not only ==
&nbsp;  executable code
}</code></pre> 
  <br>For example :
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 1;
// declare and initialize a variable that
// we will use as the condition of the loop
while (x &lt;= 5) {
&nbsp;  console.log ("x =" + x);
&nbsp;  x = x + 1;
}</code></pre> 
  <br>As a result of this code, the value of x will be output five times.
