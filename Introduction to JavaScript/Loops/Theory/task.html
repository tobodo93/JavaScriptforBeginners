  Very often we have to repeat the same block of code to perform the same operation with the same variables but with different values. In order not to write this code block every time completely, we can use 
  <b>Loops</b>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> Loops </b>execute the necessary code block the required number of times, depending on the state of the counter or on the specified condition.
  <br>
  <br>In JavaScript, we have 
  <b>two types of loops </b>:
  <br>
  <b>for</b> - execution of the code specified number of times
  <br>
  <b>while</b> - execution of the code until the condition is true.
