  Speaking of loops and exit from them, you should also mention such a tool as 
  <b></b>labels
  <b></b>. 
  <b>Labels in JavaScript</b> only work for 
  <b>loops </b>and the 
  <b>switch </b>statement, so that they can not make a full transition to any point in the program (like "goto" loops in other programming languages). You can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the 
  <code>break</code> or 
  <code>continue</code> statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.
  <br>
  <br>For example:
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">label_1: 
for (i = 1; i &lt;= 50; i ++) {
&nbsp; while (i &lt; a) {
    console.log (i);
    if (i == a) {
      break label_1;
    }

    if (i == b) {
      continue label_1;
    }
  }
}</code></pre> 
  <br>
  <br>In this example, if the i value is equal to the value of the variable "a", the outer for loop will be interrupted, and if the i value is equal to the value of the variable "b", it will exit the current iteration and continue the work of the outer loop.
