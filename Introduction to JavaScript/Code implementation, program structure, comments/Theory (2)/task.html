  <p>Now let's look at what the JavaScript code consists of.</p> 
  <p>The main unit of the code is a&nbsp;<strong>statement</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>A JavaScript statement </strong>is actually a command to the browser, an indication of what needs to be done.</p> 
  <p>It is desirable to end the statement with a semicolon ";"</p> 
  <p>This is not a mandatory requirement, according to the standard it is assumed that the browser interprets <em>End of line</em> as the end of the statement. But the use of a semicolon at the end of a statement is considered a good programming practice, and besides it allows writing several statements on one line, which is, however, considered a bad style of coding.</p> 
  <p>It should also be noted that the absence of a semicolon at the end of the line in certain cases affects the behavior of the code, so you should not use this feature without actual need.</p> 
  <p><strong>JavaScript code</strong> is a sequence of JavaScript statements. Statements are executed by the browser in the order in which they are written.</p> 
  <p><strong>JavaScript blocks</strong> are a way to group statements together. Blocks are enclosed in curly brackets: "{" and "}".</p> 
  <p>Usually blocks are used to execute several commands in a function or inside a conditional construct, these points will be covered in the following lessons.</p>
