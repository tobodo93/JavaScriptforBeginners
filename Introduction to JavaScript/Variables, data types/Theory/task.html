  <p>So what is a&nbsp;<strong>variable in JavaScript</strong>?<br> <br> Do you remember school algebra? x&nbsp;= 1, y = 2 ...<br> <br> In particular, a letter (for example "x") could be used to store a variable value (for example "1").<br> <br> These letters are called <strong>variables</strong>, and <strong>variables</strong> can be used to store values.<br> <br> Putting a value in a variable is called "<strong>assigning</strong>" a value, this is done using the "=" operation. (It should not be confused with the comparison operation - the "==" operation is used in JavaScript.) During the execution of this operation, the value of the expression located to the right of the "=" sign is assigned to the variable located to the left of the "=" sign. For example, the expression "x = 1" assigns the value "1" to the variable "x", the expression "x = y" assigns the&nbsp;value from the variable "y"&nbsp;to the variable "x" , and the expression "x = x + 1" assigns the same value increased by one to the variable "x".<br> <br> <strong>Variables in JavaScript</strong>, as well as in algebra, are used to store values ​​or expressions.<br> <br> <strong>Variable can have a name</strong>, for example "x",&nbsp;or a more informative name, for example "myPetName".<br> <br> There is a set of rules for naming JavaScript variables:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Variable names are <strong>case-sensitive</strong> (y and Y are two different variables).</li> 
   <li>Variable names <strong>must start with a letter or with one of the characters: "$" and "_" </strong></li> 
   <li>The variable name <strong>can consist of any numbers and letters of the Latin alphabet, as well as the characters "$" and "_"</strong></li> 
   <li>You <strong>can not use reserved words or keywords</strong> as variable names</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Keywords in JavaScript :</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">break, delete, function, return, typeof, case, do, if, switch, var, catch, else, in, this, void, continue, false, instanceof, throw, while, debugger, finally, new, true, with, default, for, null, try</code></pre> 
  <p>There are also reserved words&nbsp;in JavaScript&nbsp;that are not part of the language, but can become part of it the future (according to&nbsp;the ECMA-262 standard):</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">class, const, enum, export, extends, import, super</code></pre> 
  <p>It is not recommended and sometimes not allowed to use the following words&nbsp;as identifiers:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">implements, let, private, public, yield, interface, package, protected, static</code></pre> 
  <p>The value of a variable can change during the execution of the script, you can also access it by&nbsp;name to perform various actions with its contents.</p>
