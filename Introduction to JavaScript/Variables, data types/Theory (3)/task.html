  <b>Variables </b>in JavaScript can be 
  <b>Local </b>and 
  <b>Global</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Local variables</b> are variables declared within a JavaScript function. They are only available within the function in which they are declared. When you exit this function, variables are destroyed.

  <div>
   You can declare variables with the same name inside different functions - they will not overlap in any way, because they are used only within the function in which they are created.

   <b>Global variables</b> are declared outside functions and all functions and scripts can access to them. These variables are destroyed when the page is closed. 
  </div>

   If you declare a variable without using the keyword "
   <b>var</b>", then it is automatically declared 
   <b>global</b>. For example, the expressions 
   <i>x = 5;</i> or 
   <i>surName = "Ivanov";</i> will declare variables 
   <i>x</i> and 
   <i>surName</i> as 
   <b>global </b>if they do not already exist.
