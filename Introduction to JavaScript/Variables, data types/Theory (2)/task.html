  The declaration with the 
  <b>let </b>keyword has several important differences from the declaration with the keyword var.

  <div>
   1. 
   <b>Scope</b>. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   Unlike the variable declared through the keyword 
   <b>var </b>and visible inside the entire function in which the declaration occurred, the variable declared by 
   <b>let </b>is visible only inside the {...} block in which it was declared.

   2. 
   <b>Time visibility</b>. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   The variable declared by the keyword 
   <b>let</b> is visible only after the declaration, and the variable declared by the keyword 
   <b>var</b> can be available in the code up to the point in which it is declared, of course within the general rules of variable visibility.

   3. When you use a variable as a loop counter, the variable declared through the word 
   <b>var </b>lives for the duration of the loop and available even after it completes. If you use the declaration via 
   <b>let</b>, each iteration of the loop will have its own independent variable. We will consider this use case in the third module, when studying 
   <b>closures</b>.
