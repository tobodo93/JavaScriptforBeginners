  Now let's look at each data type in more detail. 
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   The type of data 
   <b>number</b> is formed if any number is assigned as a value. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   For example, the command 
   <b>var x = 5;</b> will create a variable of type 
   <b>number</b>. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   And if in this example the number 5 is enclosed in quotation marks, (var x = "5";) the type of the variable will be 
   <b>string</b>. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   <b>The type of the variable "String"</b> is obtained if the value assigned to the variable is enclosed in single or double quotes. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   The 
   <b>logical </b>data type is 
   <b>boolean</b>: these are just two variants of the value of the variable - true (true or logical 1) and false (false or Logical 0). This data type is used when applying comparison operators, logical operations, and branching operators. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   The 
   <b>undefined</b> variable has a type when it is declared but not yet initialized, so, it was created and the value has not been assigned yet. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   Data types 
   <b>object </b>and 
   <b>null</b> we will consider later.
