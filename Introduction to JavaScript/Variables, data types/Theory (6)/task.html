  <p>Now let's take a closer look at the process of solving programming problems that we will meet.</p>
  <p><b></b>The task is simple - <b>assign the input value from the variable "a", passed to our function, to the variable "x", which we return</b>.<b></b></p>
  <p>In the opened window of the editor, we see the preparation of the code. </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">function testA(a) {      // Function definition. This is service information, you can not change it.
                         // We see that the function has an input parameter - the variable "a".
    var x="";            // The declaration of the variable "x", which we will return as a result.

                     &nbsp; &nbsp; // Here you need to write a solution - the code that will put the result in "x".

&nbsp; &nbsp; return x;            // The command to output the result, it also undesirable to change.
}                        // The closing code is a curly brace, it must be present.</code></pre> 
  <br>
  <p>Also in the job, you will see the <b>Sample Input</b> and<b> Sample Outpu</b>t expressions. It is an examples. <br><b>Sample Input</b> shows what can be passed to our function as a variable "a" <br><b>Sample Output</b> demonstrates that as a result you must assign the variable "x"</p>
  <p><br>Since in next task we need to return the input data unchanged, the Sample Input and Sample Output parameters will be the same.</p>
