   <b>Increment</b> "++" 
  </div>
  <div>
   &nbsp; This operation increments the argument by one, i.e. the expression x ++ will be equivalent to the expression x = x + 1. The order of increment usage in javascript matters, for example: 
  </div>
  <div>
   <ul>
    <li>Expression x = ++ y yields the result x = 6, y = 6, since at first the value of the variable y increments by one and then the variable x the value of the variable y is assigned <br></li>
    <li>Expression x = y ++ gives the result x = 5, y = 6, since in this case the incrementation operation occurs AFTER the variable x is assigned a value from the variable y. <br></li>
   </ul>

   <b>Decrement</b> "--" &nbsp;the value of the variable by one; 
   <br>x-- is equivalent to x = x - 1. The order of decrement usage in javascript also has a value, for example: 
  </div>
  <div>
   <ul>
    <li>Expression x = -- y gives the result x = 4, y = 4 - here we first reduce the y variable by one, and then assign it to the variable x value of the variable y, <br></li>
    <li>Expression x = y-- will yield the result x = 5, y = 4 - since the decrement operation was executed AFTER the variable x was assigned a value from the variable y.<br></li>
   </ul>
