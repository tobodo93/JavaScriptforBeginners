  <b>Comparison operators:</b>
  <br>
  <br>All the following examples are considered for x = 5
  <br>
  <br>The operator 
  <b>is equal</b>&nbsp; "=="
  <br>This operation is performed with type conversion, i.e. if one of the operands is a number three and the second is a triple symbol, then the expression 3 == '3' will be true, since the second operand will be cast to the type of the first if it is allowed.
  <br>(x == 8 is false, x == y is true for y = '5')
  <br>
  <br>The operator 
  <b>is strictly equal to</b>&nbsp; "==="
  <br>This comparison will be true without taking into account the type conversion
  <br>(x === 5 is true, x === '5' is false)
  <br>
  <br>The operator
  <b> is not equal to "</b>!=" 
  <br>(x! = 8 is true)
  <br>
  <br>The operator 
  <b>is not strictly equal to "</b>!==" 
  <br>(returns true if the operands are not strictly equal or have a different type.)
  <br>
  <br>The operator
  <b> is greater than "</b>&gt;" 
  <div>
   (x&gt; 8 is false)
   <br>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   The operator 
   <b>less than</b> "&lt;"
  </div>
  <div>
   (x &lt;8 is true)
   <br>
   <br>The operator 
   <b>is greater than or equal to "</b>&gt;="
   <br>(x&gt; = 8 is false)
   <br>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   The operator 
   <b>is less than or equal to</b> "&lt;="
   <br>(x &lt;= 8 is true)
