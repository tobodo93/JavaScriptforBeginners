  <p><b></b></p>Assignment operators are as follows: 
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   In the examples we will consider x = 10; y = 5; 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   <b>Operator =</b> is a normal assignment operator. Executing x = y will result in x = 5. 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   Some arithmetic operators can be used with the assignment operator: 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   <b>Operator +=</b> This is assignment with addition
  </div>
  <div>
   Execution x += y will result in x = 15, equivalent to x = x + y
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   <b>Operator -=</b> This is assignment with subtraction
  </div>
  <div>
   Execution x -= y will lead to x = 5, is equivalent to x = x - y 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   <b>Operator *=</b> Assignment with multiplication
  </div>
  <div>
   Execution x *= y will result in x = 50, is equivalent to x = x * y 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   <b>Operator /=</b> Assignment and division. 
  </div>
  <div>
   Operation x/=y will result to x = 2, is equivalent to x = x / y 
  </div>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   <b>Operator %=</b> Assignment with "remainder of division" 
  </div>
  <div>
   operation x %= y will result in x = 0, is equivalent to x = x% y
   <p><br></p>
