  The second option for controlling the execution of the program is the 
  <b>switch</b>.
  <br>
  <br>This construction allows you to choose one of the many code options for execution, depending on the condition (usually this is the value of a single variable). The command syntax is as follows:
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">switch (n) {
  case 1:
    block of code 1;
    break;
  case 2:
    code block 2;
    break;

// .......
// other variants of case
// .......

  default:
    block of code if none of the conditions apply;
}</code></pre>
  <br>The condition expression is evaluated once, then the result of the expression is compared with each case in the given construction.
  <br>If the condition is the same, then the code block associated with the corresponding case is executed. If no condition is met, the code specified in the 
  <b>default </b>block, if any, is executed. To exit the structure, use the 
  <b>break </b>command. If you do not specify it, the code block will automatically execute in the next case, etc.
