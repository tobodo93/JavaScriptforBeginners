  In this lesson we will consider options for changing the behavior of the program depending on the values ​​of the given condition. 
  <div>
   These constructions are called 
   <b>conditional statements</b>.
   <br>In JavaScript, there are two possible conditional statements: 
   <b>if ... else</b> construct and 
   <b>switch</b>
   <br>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   The first one is used to execute some code if the specified condition is true.
   <br>
   <pre><code class="language-javascript">if (condition) {
code to execute if the condition is true
}</code></pre> 
   <br>
   <br>Let's look at an example:
   <br>
   <pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 10;
var y = 50;

if (x &gt; 11) {
 x += y;
}</code></pre> 
   <br>
   <br>In this example, the operator checks the condition and if x is greater than 11, then the variable x is incremented by y.
