   3. Learning the DOM and managing it using JavaScript. 
   <b>DOM (Document Object Model)</b> is an object model of the document, through which you can work with HTML document tags as with an object tree, each of which has its own unique address. By accessing this address using JavaScript, you can access or manipulate an HTML object and control its properties-resize, color, and the like.

   4. Study 
   <b>BOM (Browser Object Model)</b> - a structure that has a similar structure to the DOM and includes browser elements - browser windows, status bar, browsing history and others. They can also be controlled using JavaScript.
