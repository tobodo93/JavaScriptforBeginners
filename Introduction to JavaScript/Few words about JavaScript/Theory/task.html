  <b>JavaScript </b> is a programming language that is executed on the user's side using a browser. It allows you to control the elements of a web page - to make them change their properties and location, move, react to events such as moving a mouse or pressing a keyboard, and create many other interesting effects.

  <b>JavaScript </b>is often abbreviated to 
  <b>JS</b>, which is often used in the names of different frameworks (Node.js, Ember.js) and also in the extension of files with JavaScript code.

  <span style="color: #66cc66;">Sun Microsystems</span> as a language for managing elements and ensuring the interaction of constituent parts of web resources - images, plug-ins, Java applets and other elements used for creating web pages.

  <b>JavaScript</b> has a syntax similar to the C language, but it has a number of significant differences:
  <br>- Ability to work with objects, including determining the type and structure of the object during program execution.
  <br>- Ability to transfer and return functions as parameters, and also assign them to a variable.
  <br>- Presence of the automatic type matching mechanism.
  <br>- Automatic garbage collection.
  <br>- Using anonymous functions.
