  What next?
  <br>
  <br>If you liked, then the logical continuation of learning the basics of the JavaScript language will be the study of such concepts as document and browser object models (DOM - document object model and BOM - browser object model), which will require basic knowledge of markup HTML.

  <br>After that, you can proceed to the study of the main libraries used in the development of the frontend - external, ie. client presentation of the website.
